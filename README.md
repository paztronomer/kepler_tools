# kepler_tools
Tools for Kepler raw data reading, reduction and model. 
The scripts are mainly oriented to analysis of photometric variability in light curves being a tracers of stellar rotation.

This repo includes python scripts for read FITS files and convert it to tables, to merge different quarters using the approach of Banyai et al. 2013, erasing outliers by Iglewicz & Hoaglin criteria.

I will upload (soon, 'cause the motherboard of my notebook fried days ago): scripts to basic sinusoidal model by Fast Lomb Scargle, and to estimate errors by Monte Carlo Markov Chains approach of Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013** (emcee project on github)

Scripts are simpler and commented, please refer to me if use it of your research work.
